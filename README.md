# Arduino-Scripts

Download Arduino software here:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
Install all the drivers.

Once you launch the program, go to Sketch>Include Library>Add .ZIP Libary...

Select the folder containing the Tinkerkit.cpp/.h and SimpleTimer.cpp/.h files.

Now open the "reward_delivery" sketch from File>Open...

It will ask to put the folder in a new subfolder, hit yes and save wherever you'd like.

Make sure the program is talking to your Arduino by going to Tools>Port>. It should select the Arduino.

Hit the check mark button to make sure the code compiles, then hit the rightward arrow button to upload it to your board.
